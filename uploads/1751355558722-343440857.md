Below is a **classified list of the GATE CSE syllabus** for 2025, organized into clear categories based on the official structure. This covers all **10 technical sections** and **General Aptitude**, as requested, without additional details or study plans. The syllabus is consistent with the latest available information, but verify with the official GATE 2026 website for any updates.
